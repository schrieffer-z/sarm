# RewardBench 2 Evaluation Dataset Card

The RewardBench 2 evaluation dataset is the new version of RewardBench that is based on unseen human data and designed to be substantially more difficult! RewardBench 2 evaluates capabilities of reward models over the following categories:
1. **Factuality** (*NEW!*): Tests the ability of RMs to detect hallucinations and other basic errors in completions.
2. **Precise Instruction Following** (*NEW!*): Tests the ability of RMs to judge whether text follows precise instructions, such as "Answer without the letter u".
3. **Math**: Tests RMs' abilities at math, on open-ended human prompts ranging from middle school physics and geometry to college-level chemistry, calculus, combinatorics, and more.
4. **Safety**: Tests RMs' abilities to correctly comply with or refuse prompts related to harmful use cases as well as general compliance behaviors.
5. **Focus**: Tests RMs' ability to detect high-quality, on-topic answers to general user queries.
6. **Ties** (*NEW*!): This new type of subset tests the robustness of RMs in domains with many possible similar answers. For example, the question "Name a color of the rainbow" has seven possible correct answers and infinitely many incorrect ones.

The RewardBench 2 leaderboard averages over these six subsets.
For the first five categories, the scoring for RewardBench 2 evaluates success as whether the score of a prompt-chosen pair is greater than the score of *three* prompt-rejected pairs. 
The "Ties" score is a weighted score of accuracy (as measured by *all* valid correct answers being scored higher than *all* incorrect answers) and whether the reward margin between correct and incorrect answers exceeds that of the highest and lowest-scored correct responses. This metric rewards not only correctness, but also a model's ability to prioritize correct answers over incorrect ones more strongly than it distinguishes between equally valid correct responses.

## Dataset Construction Summary
| Domain | Count | Prompt Source | Method of generating completions | Completion Filtering |
|--------|-------|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|

| Ties | 102 | Manual | System Prompt Variation | Manual verification |

## Dataset Details

Each sample in the dataset has the following items.
Note, the dataset is single-turn:
* `prompt` (`str`): the instruction given in the various test sets.
* `chosen` (`list[str]`): the chosen response(s) (1 chosen response for all subsets but ties)
* `rejected` (`list[str]`): the rejected responses (3 chosen responses for all subsets but ties)
* `num_correct` (`int`): the number of chosen responses
* `num_rejected` (`int`): the number of rejected responses
* `total_completions` (`int`): the total number of responses
* `models` (`list[str]`): a list of models that the chosen and rejected responses are generated from, respectively
* `subset` (`str`): the subset the datapoint is part of.
* `id` (`int`): an incremented id for every prompt in the benchmark.

To select a specific subset use HuggingFace Datasets `.filter` functionality.
```
dataset = dataset.filter(lambda ex: ex["subset"] == "Factuality")
```
