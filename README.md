# SARM:

# Environment
We provide an environment.yml including the python package versions we used in our experiments. For optimal reproducibility, we recommend using the same package versions. However, please note that results may still vary due to differences in hardware configurations and CUDA versions, etc.

# Training Scripts

```shell
bash recipes/sarm_train.sh
