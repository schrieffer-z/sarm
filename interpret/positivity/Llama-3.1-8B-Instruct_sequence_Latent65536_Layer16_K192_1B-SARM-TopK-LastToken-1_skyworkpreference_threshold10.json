        "## Step 1: Visualizing the Problem\nThe problem involves a pyramid $OABCD$ with a square base $ABCD$ and congruent edges $\\overline{OA}, \\overline{OB}, \\overline{OC},$ and $\\overline{OD}$. The angle $AOB$ is given as $45^\\circ$, and we need to find the measure of the dihedral angle formed by faces $OAB$ and $OBC$, denoted as $\\theta$.\n\n## Step 2: Breaking Down the Problem\nTo tackle this problem, we can first identify the perpendiculars drawn from $A$ and $C$ to point $B$, meeting $\\overline{OB}$ at $P.$ Without loss of generality, let $AP = 1$. From this setup, we can derive that $\\triangle OPA$ is a $45-45-90$ right triangle, giving us $OP = AP = 1$, $OB = OA = \\sqrt {2}$, and $AB = \\sqrt {4 - 2\\sqrt {2}}.$ Therefore, we can deduce that $AC = \\sqrt {8 - 4\\sqrt {2}}.$\n\n## Step 3: Understanding the Dihedral Angle\nTo find the dihedral angle $\\theta$, we use the Law of Cosines to relate the side lengths of triangle $APC$ with the cosine of $\\theta$. Applying the Law of Cosines yields $AC^{2} = AP^{2} + PC^{2} - 2(AP)(PC)\\cos \\theta.$ By substituting known values, we can solve for $\\cos \\theta$ and obtain the value of $\\theta$.\n\n## Step 4: Applying the Law of Cosines\nPlugging the known values into the Law of Cosines equation, we can solve for $\\cos \\theta$. With $AC^{2} = 8 - 4\\sqrt {2}$, $AP^{2} = 1$, and $PC^{2} = 1$, we can calculate $\\cos \\theta = - 3 + 2\\sqrt {2} = - 3 + \\sqrt{8}.$\n\n## Step 5: Obtaining the Final Answer\nFinally, given that $\\cos \\theta = - 3 + \\sqrt{8}$, where $m = -3$ and $n = 8$, the problem asks us to find the sum $m + n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$<|eot_id|>",

        "## Step 1: Visualizing the Problem\nThe problem involves a pyramid $OABCD$ with a square base $ABCD$ and congruent edges $\\overline{OA}, \\overline{OB}, \\overline{OC},$ and $\\overline{OD}$. The angle $AOB$ is given as $45^\\circ$, and we need to find the measure of the dihedral angle formed by faces $OAB$ and $OBC$, denoted as $\\theta$.\n\n## Step 2: Breaking Down the Problem\nTo tackle this problem, we can first identify the perpendiculars drawn from $A$ and $C$ to point $B$, meeting $\\overline{OB}$ at $P.$ Without loss of generality, let $AP = 1$. From this setup, we can derive that $\\triangle OPA$ is a $45-45-90$ right triangle, giving us $OP = AP = 1$, $OB = OA = \\sqrt {2}$, and $AB = \\sqrt {4 - 2\\sqrt {2}}.$ Therefore, we can deduce that $AC = \\sqrt {8 - 4\\sqrt {2}}.$\n\n## Step 3: Understanding the Dihedral Angle\nTo find the dihedral angle $\\theta$, we use the Law of Cosines to relate the side lengths of triangle $APC$ with the cosine of $\\theta$. Applying the Law of Cosines yields $AC^{2} = AP^{2} + PC^{2} - 2(AP)(PC)\\cos \\theta.$ By substituting known values, we can solve for $\\cos \\theta$ and obtain the value of $\\theta$.\n\n## Step 4: Applying the Law of Cosines\nPlugging the known values into the Law of Cosines equation, we can solve for $\\cos \\theta$. With $AC^{2} = 8 - 4\\sqrt {2}$, $AP^{2} = 1$, and $PC^{2} = 1$, we can calculate $\\cos \\theta = - 3 + 2\\sqrt {2} = - 3 + \\sqrt{8}.$\n\n## Step 5: Obtaining the Final Answer\nFinally, given that $\\cos \\theta = - 3 + \\sqrt{8}$, where $m = -3$ and $n = 8$, the problem asks us to find the sum $m + n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$<|eot_id|>",

This gives us $A(1, A(2, 0))$.\n## Step 3:  Now we need to compute $A(2, 0)$, and according to the second case, since $m > 0$ and $n = 0$, we have $A(m-1, 1)$. This results in $A(1, 1)$.\n## Step 4:  Substituting back into our original expression, we now have $A(1, A(1, 1))$.\n## Step 5:  To compute $A(1, 1)$, we apply the third case again, which yields $A(0, A(1, 0))$. Following the second case for $A(1, 0)$ gives us $A(0, 1)$.\n## Step 6:  Since $A(0, 1)$ is in the base case form, we use the first case to get $1+1 = 2$.

According to the properties of absolute value, $|z^2| = |24-32i|$.\n## Step 3:  The absolute value of a complex number $a+bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

Therefore, we can write the equation as $\\angle QPS + \\angle QPR + \\angle RPS = 180^\\circ$.\n## Step 5:  We already know the measures of $\\angle QPS$ and $\\angle QPR$ from the given diagram, which are $48^\\circ$ and $67^\\circ$, respectively.\n## Step 6:  Additionally, we also know the measure of $\\angle SPR$, which is $38^\\circ$.\n## Step 7:  Using the angle sum property, we can find the measure of $\\angle RPS$ by rearranging the equation to solve for $\\angle RPS$.\n## Step 8:  Hence, we can find the measure of $\\angle RPS$ as $180^\\circ - 48^\\circ - 67^\\circ - 38^\\circ$.\n## Step 9:  Solving this, we get $\\angle RPS = 180^\\circ - 153^\\circ = 27^\\circ$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the measure of $\\angle RPS$ is $\\boxed{27}$ degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$<|eot_id|>",

Then, using the table again, we find that $f(5) = 8$. Therefore, $f(f(3)) = 8$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate $f(f^{-1}(4))$\nSince $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$, applying $f$ to the result of $f^{-1}(4)$ will give us back $4$ because $f^{-1}(4)$ will give us the value of $x$ for which $f(x) = 4$. According to the table, $f^{-1}(4)$ should give us the value of $x$ that corresponds to $f(x) = 4$, but since there's no direct inverse given in the table, we rely on the definition of an inverse to conclude that $f(f^{-1}(4)) = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5))$\nFirst, we need to find $f^{-1}(5)$. From the table, we can see that $f(3) = 5$, so $f^{-1}(5) = 3$. Then, we need to find $f^{-1}(3)$. Since $f(2) = 3$ according to the table, $f^{-1}(3) = 2$.

Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as $2^{x+5} = (2^3)^{x-1}$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply exponent rule to the right side\nUsing the rule $(a^b)^c = a^{b \\cdot c}$, we can simplify the right side of the equation to $2^{3(x-1)}$.\n\n## Step 3: Equate the exponents\nNow we have $2^{x+5} = 2^{3(x-1)}$. Since the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents, giving $x+5 = 3(x-1)$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the linear equation\nExpanding the right side of the equation, we get $x + 5 = 3x - 3$.

The angle $AOB$ is given as $45^\\circ$, and we need to find the measure of the dihedral angle formed by faces $OAB$ and $OBC$, denoted as $\\theta$.\n\n## Step 2: Breaking Down the Problem\nTo tackle this problem, we can first identify the perpendiculars drawn from $A$ and $C$ to point $B$, meeting $\\overline{OB}$ at $P.$ Without loss of generality, let $AP = 1$. From this setup, we can derive that $\\triangle OPA$ is a $45-45-90$ right triangle, giving us $OP = AP = 1$, $OB = OA = \\sqrt {2}$, and $AB = \\sqrt {4 - 2\\sqrt {2}}.$ Therefore, we can deduce that $AC = \\sqrt {8 - 4\\sqrt {2}}.$\n\n## Step 3: Understanding the Dihedral Angle\nTo find the dihedral angle $\\theta$, we use the Law of Cosines to relate the side lengths of triangle $APC$ with the cosine of $\\theta$. Applying the Law of Cosines yields $AC^{2} = AP^{2} + PC^{2} - 2(AP)(PC)\\cos \\theta.$ By substituting known values, we can solve for $\\cos \\theta$ and obtain the value of $\\theta$.\n\n## Step 4: Applying the Law of Cosines\nPlugging the known values into the Law of Cosines equation, we can solve for $\\cos \\theta$. With $AC^{2} = 8 - 4\\sqrt {2}$, $AP^{2} = 1$, and $PC^{2} = 1$, we can calculate $\\cos \\theta = - 3 + 2\\sqrt {2} = - 3 + \\sqrt{8}.$\n\n## Step 5: Obtaining the Final Answer\nFinally, given that $\\cos \\theta = - 3 + \\sqrt{8}$, where $m = -3$ and $n = 8$, the problem asks us to find the sum $m + n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$<|eot_id|>",

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number). This means \\(b = c = d = 2\\) as well.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum product abcd based on the equality condition\nWith \\(a = b = c = d = 2\\), the product \\(abcd = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\). This gives us the minimum value of \\(abcd\\) under the given constraint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$<|eot_id|>",

Given that $f(2) = -5$ and $f(5) = 16$, we can write the equations as $2a + d = -5$ and $5a + d = 16$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the system of equations from step 1 to find the values of $a$ and $d$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation gives $3a = 21$. Solving for $a$ gives $a = 7$. Substituting $a = 7$ into the first equation $2a + d = -5$ gives $2(7) + d = -5$. Solving for $d$ gives $d = -19$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the values of $a$ and $d$ from step 2 to find the value of $f(50)$, which is $x$.\nSubstituting $a = 7$ and $d = -19$ into $f(x) = ax + d$, we get $f(x) = 7x - 19$.

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number).

        "## Step 1: Identify the conditions of the function $f(x)$.\nThe function $f(x)$ is defined in two parts: for $x < 20$, $f(x) = x + 3$, and for $x \\ge 20$, $f(x) = 2x - 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Understand what the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ represents.\n$f^{-1}(x)$ represents the value of $x$ that results in a given output of $f(x)$. We need to find $f^{-1}(7)$ and $f^{-1}(46)$, which are the inputs to $f(x)$ that produce outputs of 7 and 46, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Find $f^{-1}(7)$.\nTo find $f^{-1}(7)$, we must find the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 7$. Considering the conditions of $f(x)$, for $x < 20$, we solve $x + 3 = 7$ to get $x = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Find $f^{-1}(46)$.\nTo find $f^{-1}(46)$, we must find the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 46$. Considering the conditions of $f(x)$, for $x \\ge 20$, we solve $2x - 2 = 46$ to get $x = 24$.\n\n## Step 5: Add $f^{-1}(7)$ and $f^{-1}(46)$ to find the answer.\nWe have $f^{-1}(7) = 4$ and $f^{-1}(46) = 24$, so $f^{-1}(7) + f^{-1}(46) = 4 + 24 = 28$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$<|eot_id|>",

According to the problem, the roots of $g(x)$ are the squares of the roots of $f(x)$, which means the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1^2$, $r_2^2$, and $r_3^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall Vieta's formulas for relating coefficients to roots\nVieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + px^2 + qx + r$ with roots $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ state that:\n- $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -p$\n- $r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = q$\n- $r_1r_2r_3 = -r$\n\n## Step 3: Apply Vieta's formulas to f(x) to find the sum, products, and triple product of its roots\nFor $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 3$, according to Vieta's formulas:\n- $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -1$\n- $r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = 2$\n- $r_1r_2r_3 = -3$\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the coefficients of g(x) using the squared roots and Vieta's formulas\nNow, applying Vieta's formulas to $g(x)$ with roots $r_1^2$, $r_2^2$, and $r_3^2$:\n- $b = -(r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2)$\n- $c = r_1^2r_2^2 + r_2^2r_3^2 + r_3^2r_1^2$\n- $d = -r_1^2r_2^2r_3^2$\n\n## Step 5: Compute b\nRecall that $(r_1 + r_2 + r_3)^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2 + 2(r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1)$. Therefore, $r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2 = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3)^2 - 2(r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1) = (-1)^2 - 2(2) = 1 - 4 = -3$. So, $b = -(-3) = 3$.\n\n## Step 6: Compute c\nWe know $c = r_1^2r_2^2 + r_2^2r_3^2 + r_3^2r_1^2 = (r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1)^2 - 2(r_1r_2r_3)(r_1 + r_2 + r_3)$. Plugging in the values from step 3, we get $c = (2)^2 - 2(-3)(-1) = 4 - 6 = -2$.\n\n## Step 7: Compute d\nSince $d = -r_1^2r_2^2r_3^2 = -(r_1r_2r_3)^2$, then $d = -(-3)^2 = -9$.\n\n## Step 8: Form the ordered triple (b,c,d)\nCombining the calculated values from steps 5, 6, and 7, the ordered triple is $(3, -2, -9)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 3, \\  -2, \\  -9\\right)}$<|eot_id|>",

We are given that $A = 24$ and $P = 22$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the relationship between length and width using the area.\nFrom $A = length \\times width$, and knowing $A = 24$, we can express one variable in terms of the other, for example, $width = \\frac{24}{length}$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the expression for width into the perimeter formula.\nSubstituting $width = \\frac{24}{length}$ into the perimeter formula $P = 2 \\times (length + width)$ gives $22 = 2 \\times (length + \\frac{24}{length})$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for length.\nDistribute the 2 in the equation: $22 = 2length + \\frac{48}{length}$. Multiply every term by length to clear the denominator: $22length = 2length^2 + 48$. Rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form: $2length^2 - 22length + 48 = 0$. Simplify by dividing the whole equation by 2 to make the calculations easier: $length^2 - 11length + 24 = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation for length.\nFactor the quadratic equation to solve for length: $(length - 8)(length - 3) = 0$. This gives two possible solutions for length: $length = 8$ or $length = 3$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the appropriate solution based on the context.\nSince the rectangle has a positive integer length and width, and typically the length is considered the longer side, we choose the larger value as the length.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$<|eot_id|>",

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number). This means \\(b = c = d = 2\\) as well.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum product abcd based on the equality condition\nWith \\(a = b = c = d = 2\\), the product \\(abcd = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\). This gives us the minimum value of \\(abcd\\) under the given constraint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$<|eot_id|>",

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number).

        "## Step 1: Understand the relation between the roots of f(x) and g(x)\nLet's denote the roots of $f(x)$ as $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$. According to the problem, the roots of $g(x)$ are the squares of the roots of $f(x)$, which means the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1^2$, $r_2^2$, and $r_3^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall Vieta's formulas for relating coefficients to roots\nVieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + px^2 + qx + r$ with roots $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ state that:\n- $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -p$\n- $r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = q$\n- $r_1r_2r_3 = -r$\n\n## Step 3: Apply Vieta's formulas to f(x) to find the sum, products, and triple product of its roots\nFor $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 3$, according to Vieta's formulas:\n- $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -1$\n- $r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = 2$\n- $r_1r_2r_3 = -3$\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the coefficients of g(x) using the squared roots and Vieta's formulas\nNow, applying Vieta's formulas to $g(x)$ with roots $r_1^2$, $r_2^2$, and $r_3^2$:\n- $b = -(r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2)$\n- $c = r_1^2r_2^2 + r_2^2r_3^2 + r_3^2r_1^2$\n- $d = -r_1^2r_2^2r_3^2$\n\n## Step 5: Compute b\nRecall that $(r_1 + r_2 + r_3)^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2 + 2(r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1)$. Therefore, $r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2 = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3)^2 - 2(r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1) = (-1)^2 - 2(2) = 1 - 4 = -3$. So, $b = -(-3) = 3$.\n\n## Step 6: Compute c\nWe know $c = r_1^2r_2^2 + r_2^2r_3^2 + r_3^2r_1^2 = (r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1)^2 - 2(r_1r_2r_3)(r_1 + r_2 + r_3)$. Plugging in the values from step 3, we get $c = (2)^2 - 2(-3)(-1) = 4 - 6 = -2$.\n\n## Step 7: Compute d\nSince $d = -r_1^2r_2^2r_3^2 = -(r_1r_2r_3)^2$, then $d = -(-3)^2 = -9$.\n\n## Step 8: Form the ordered triple (b,c,d)\nCombining the calculated values from steps 5, 6, and 7, the ordered triple is $(3, -2, -9)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 3, \\  -2, \\  -9\\right)}$<|eot_id|>",

        "## Step 1: Recall Vieta's formulas to relate the roots of a polynomial to its coefficients.\nVieta's formulas state that for a cubic polynomial of the form $f(x) = x^3 + px^2 + qx + r$ with roots $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$, the following relations hold: $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = -p$, $\\alpha\\beta + \\alpha\\gamma + \\beta\\gamma = q$, and $\\alpha\\beta\\gamma = -r$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Vieta's formulas to the polynomial $f(x)$ to find the sum, the sum of the products taken two at a time, and the product of its roots.\nGiven $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 3$, applying Vieta's formulas we find that for roots $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$: $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = -1$, $\\alpha\\beta + \\alpha\\gamma + \\beta\\gamma = 2$, and $\\alpha\\beta\\gamma = -3$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the relations for the squares of the roots as they apply to $g(x)$ using the information from $f(x)$.\nLet the roots of $g(x)$ be $\\alpha^2$, $\\beta^2$, and $\\gamma^2$. We need to find expressions for $\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 + \\gamma^2$, $\\alpha^2\\beta^2 + \\alpha^2\\gamma^2 + \\beta^2\\gamma^2$, and $\\alpha^2\\beta^2\\gamma^2$ to use in $g(x)$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 + \\gamma^2$.\nFrom $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = -1$, when we square both sides, we get $\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 + \\gamma^2 + 2(\\alpha\\beta + \\alpha\\gamma + \\beta\\gamma) = 1$. Given $\\alpha\\beta + \\alpha\\gamma + \\beta\\gamma = 2$, we can substitute this in to find $\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 + \\gamma^2 = 1 - 2*2 = -3$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $\\alpha^2\\beta^2 + \\alpha^2\\gamma^2 + \\beta^2\\gamma^2$.\nSince we know $\\alpha\\beta + \\alpha\\gamma + \\beta\\gamma = 2$, squaring both sides gives us $(\\alpha\\beta)^2 + (\\alpha\\gamma)^2 + (\\beta\\gamma)^2 + 2(\\alpha\\beta\\gamma)(\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma) = 4$. Given $\\alpha\\beta\\gamma = -3$ and $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = -1$, substituting these values in allows us to solve for $(\\alpha\\beta)^2 + (\\alpha\\gamma)^2 + (\\beta\\gamma)^2 = 4 + 6 = 10$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $\\alpha^2\\beta^2\\gamma^2$.\nThis is directly obtained by squaring $\\alpha\\beta\\gamma = -3$, resulting in $\\alpha^2\\beta^2\\gamma^2 = 9$.\n\n## Step 7: Use the calculated values for the squares of the roots in the expression for $g(x)$ to find $b$, $c$, and $d$.\nThe coefficients for $g(x)$, based on Vieta's formulas applied to the squares of the roots, are: $b = -(\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 + \\gamma^2)$, $c = \\alpha^2\\beta^2 + \\alpha^2\\gamma^2 + \\beta^2\\gamma^2$, and $d = -\\alpha^2\\beta^2\\gamma^2$.

However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number).

We also know that $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime and each is less than 20.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the equation to explore factorization\nTo work with the equation $xy + x + y = 95$, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation to help with factorization: $xy + x + y + 1 = 96$. Recognizing the form of this equation, we can apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick\nThe equation can be rewritten as $(x+1)(y+1) = 96$. This gives us a way to find the pairs of factors of 96, which can help in determining possible values for $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 4: Find pairs of factors of 96 and account for constraints\nNow, we look for pairs of factors of 96 that differ by more than 1 (to ensure relatively prime numbers) and are less than 21 when subtracted by 1 (to meet the condition that each integer is less than 20).\n\n## Step 5: List and evaluate factor pairs\n96 has several factor pairs: (1, 96), (2, 48), (3, 32), (4, 24), (6, 16), and (8, 12). However, after subtracting 1 from each factor, we need both resulting numbers to be less than 20 and relatively prime.\n\n## Step 6: Identify suitable pairs meeting all conditions\nFrom the factor pairs of 96, the pair (8, 12) when reduced by 1 gives us (7, 11), which meets all the given conditions: their product plus their sum equals 95, they are relatively prime, and each is less than 20.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the two integers\nNow that we have identified the two integers as 7 and 11, we simply need to calculate their sum to answer the question.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$<|eot_id|>",

However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number).

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number). This means \\(b = c = d = 2\\) as well.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum product abcd based on the equality condition\nWith \\(a = b = c = d = 2\\), the product \\(abcd = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\). This gives us the minimum value of \\(abcd\\) under the given constraint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$<|eot_id|>",

Thus, $\\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{47}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $n$\nFrom $\\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{47}$, it follows that $n = 47$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{47}$<|eot_id|>",

In this case, we set $2x + 7 = 0$ to get $x = -\\frac{7}{2}$. We will substitute $x = -\\frac{7}{2}$ into the polynomial $6x^3+19x^2+cx+35$ and solve for $c$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute $x = -\\frac{7}{2}$ into the polynomial.\nUsing the remainder theorem with $x = -\\frac{7}{2}$, we have:\n\\[6\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3 + 19\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 + c\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right) + 35 = 0\\]\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $c$.\nFirst, compute the terms separately:\n\\[6\\left(-\\frac{343}{8}\\right) + 19\\left(\\frac{49}{4}\\right) + c\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right) + 35 = 0\\]\n\\[-\\frac{1029}{4} + \\frac{931}{4} - \\frac{7c}{2} + 35 = 0\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[-\\frac{98}{4} - \\frac{7c}{2} + \\frac{140}{4} = 0\\]\n\\[-98 + 140 - 14c = 0\\]\n\\[42 - 14c = 0\\]\n\\[42 = 14c\\]\n\\[c = 3\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$<|eot_id|>",

        "## Step 1: Understand the relationship between the area and perimeter of a rectangle.\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the formula $A = length \\times width$, and the perimeter is given by the formula $P = 2 \\times (length + width)$. We are given that $A = 24$ and $P = 22$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the relationship between length and width using the area.\nFrom $A = length \\times width$, and knowing $A = 24$, we can express one variable in terms of the other, for example, $width = \\frac{24}{length}$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the expression for width into the perimeter formula.\nSubstituting $width = \\frac{24}{length}$ into the perimeter formula $P = 2 \\times (length + width)$ gives $22 = 2 \\times (length + \\frac{24}{length})$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for length.\nDistribute the 2 in the equation: $22 = 2length + \\frac{48}{length}$. Multiply every term by length to clear the denominator: $22length = 2length^2 + 48$. Rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form: $2length^2 - 22length + 48 = 0$. Simplify by dividing the whole equation by 2 to make the calculations easier: $length^2 - 11length + 24 = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation for length.\nFactor the quadratic equation to solve for length: $(length - 8)(length - 3) = 0$. This gives two possible solutions for length: $length = 8$ or $length = 3$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the appropriate solution based on the context.\nSince the rectangle has a positive integer length and width, and typically the length is considered the longer side, we choose the larger value as the length.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$<|eot_id|>",

This implies that $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $\\tan b = 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the values of cosine and tangent for angle $a$.\nFrom $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$, we can find $\\cos a$ by using the Pythagorean identity: $\\cos^2 a = 1 - \\sin^2 a$. Substituting $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$ gives $\\cos^2 a = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{16}{25}$. Therefore, $\\cos a = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}} = \\pm \\frac{4}{5}$. Since $a$ is an angle in the first quadrant where cosine is positive, we take $\\cos a = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the values of sine and cosine for angle $b$.\nFrom $\\tan b = 2$, we know that $\\frac{\\sin b}{\\cos b} = 2$. This implies $\\sin b = 2 \\cos b$. Using the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 b + \\cos^2 b = 1$ and substituting $\\sin b = 2 \\cos b$, we get $(2\\cos b)^2 + \\cos^2 b = 1$, which simplifies to $5\\cos^2 b = 1$. Therefore, $\\cos^2 b = \\frac{1}{5}$, and thus $\\cos b = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$. Since $b$ is an angle in the first quadrant where cosine is positive, we take $\\cos b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ and then normalize it to $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$.\nFrom $\\sin b = 2\\cos b$ and $\\cos b = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, we find that $\\sin b = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $\\sin(a+b)$ using the values found.\nTo find $\\sin (a + b)$, we use the angle addition formula for sine: $\\sin(a + b) = \\sin a \\cos b + \\cos a \\sin b$.\nSubstituting the known values, we get $\\sin \\left( \\sin^{-1} \\frac{3}{5} + \\tan^{-1} 2 \\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic calculation for $\\sin(a+b)$.\n$\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{25} + \\frac{8\\sqrt{5}}{25}$.\nAdding the fractions gives us $\\frac{11\\sqrt{5}}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11\\sqrt{5}}{25}}$<|eot_id|>",

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number). This means \\(b = c = d = 2\\) as well.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum product abcd based on the equality condition\nWith \\(a = b = c = d = 2\\), the product \\(abcd = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\).

We already know $AH = 3$, and since $AB = 4$, we have $BH^2 + AH^2 = AB^2$. Substituting the known values gives $BH^2 + 3^2 = 4^2$. Thus, $BH^2 = 16 - 9 = 7$, so $BH = \\sqrt{7}$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BC\nNow, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to right triangle $\\triangle BHC$. With $HC = 1$ and $BH = \\sqrt{7}$, we find $BC^2 = BH^2 + HC^2 = (\\sqrt{7})^2 + 1^2 = 7 + 1 = 8$. Therefore, $BC = \\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$<|eot_id|>",

Solving for $c$, we obtain $-4c\\geq-29$, and dividing both sides by $-4$ requires us to reverse the inequality, resulting in $c\\leq\\frac{29}{4}$.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nTo ensure that the value $1$ is within the range of the function $f(x)$, the largest value of $c$ must satisfy $c\\leq\\frac{29}{4}$.

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number). This means \\(b = c = d = 2\\) as well.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum product abcd based on the equality condition\nWith \\(a = b = c = d = 2\\), the product \\(abcd = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\).

Substituting $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$ gives $\\cos^2 a = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{16}{25}$. Therefore, $\\cos a = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}} = \\pm \\frac{4}{5}$. Since $a$ is an angle in the first quadrant where cosine is positive, we take $\\cos a = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the values of sine and cosine for angle $b$.\nFrom $\\tan b = 2$, we know that $\\frac{\\sin b}{\\cos b} = 2$.

Substituting the doubled dimensions gives \\(d_{new}^2 = 12^2 + 16^2\\), which is \\(144 + 256 = 400\\).

Given that $f(2) = -5$ and $f(5) = 16$, we can write the equations as $2a + d = -5$ and $5a + d = 16$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the system of equations from step 1 to find the values of $a$ and $d$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation gives $3a = 21$. Solving for $a$ gives $a = 7$. Substituting $a = 7$ into the first equation $2a + d = -5$ gives $2(7) + d = -5$. Solving for $d$ gives $d = -19$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the values of $a$ and $d$ from step 2 to find the value of $f(50)$, which is $x$.\nSubstituting $a = 7$ and $d = -19$ into $f(x) = ax + d$, we get $f(x) = 7x - 19$.

This implies that $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $\\tan b = 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the values of cosine and tangent for angle $a$.\nFrom $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$, we can find $\\cos a$ by using the Pythagorean identity: $\\cos^2 a = 1 - \\sin^2 a$.

Considering the conditions of $f(x)$, for $x < 20$, we solve $x + 3 = 7$ to get $x = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Find $f^{-1}(46)$.\nTo find $f^{-1}(46)$, we must find the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 46$.

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number). This means \\(b = c = d = 2\\) as well.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum product abcd based on the equality condition\nWith \\(a = b = c = d = 2\\), the product \\(abcd = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\).

This gives us a total of $4$ possibilities for $p$.\n## Step 6:  Since we are choosing an integer $p$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive, the total number of choices for $p$ is $10$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability of choosing a value of $p$ that satisfies the equation is $\\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$<|eot_id|>",

        "## Step 1: Identify the values from the given inverse trigonometric functions.\nLet $a = \\sin^{-1} \\frac{3}{5}$ and $b = \\tan^{-1} 2$. This implies that $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $\\tan b = 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the values of cosine and tangent for angle $a$.\nFrom $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$, we can find $\\cos a$ by using the Pythagorean identity: $\\cos^2 a = 1 - \\sin^2 a$. Substituting $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$ gives $\\cos^2 a = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{16}{25}$. Therefore, $\\cos a = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}} = \\pm \\frac{4}{5}$. Since $a$ is an angle in the first quadrant where cosine is positive, we take $\\cos a = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the values of sine and cosine for angle $b$.\nFrom $\\tan b = 2$, we know that $\\frac{\\sin b}{\\cos b} = 2$. This implies $\\sin b = 2 \\cos b$. Using the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 b + \\cos^2 b = 1$ and substituting $\\sin b = 2 \\cos b$, we get $(2\\cos b)^2 + \\cos^2 b = 1$, which simplifies to $5\\cos^2 b = 1$. Therefore, $\\cos^2 b = \\frac{1}{5}$, and thus $\\cos b = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$. Since $b$ is an angle in the first quadrant where cosine is positive, we take $\\cos b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ and then normalize it to $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$.\nFrom $\\sin b = 2\\cos b$ and $\\cos b = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, we find that $\\sin b = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $\\sin(a+b)$ using the values found.\nTo find $\\sin (a + b)$, we use the angle addition formula for sine: $\\sin(a + b) = \\sin a \\cos b + \\cos a \\sin b$.\nSubstituting the known values, we get $\\sin \\left( \\sin^{-1} \\frac{3}{5} + \\tan^{-1} 2 \\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic calculation for $\\sin(a+b)$.\n$\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{25} + \\frac{8\\sqrt{5}}{25}$.\nAdding the fractions gives us $\\frac{11\\sqrt{5}}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11\\sqrt{5}}{25}}$<|eot_id|>",

Here, we need to substitute $x = -2$ into the polynomial and solve for one of the variables.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute $x = -2$ into the polynomial\nBy substituting $x = -2$, we get: $(-2)^5 - (-2)^4 + (-2)^3 - p(-2)^2 + q(-2) + 4 = 0$. Simplify to get: $-32 - 16 - 8 - 4p - 2q + 4 = 0$. This further simplifies to $-52 - 4p - 2q = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the Factor Theorem for the second root\nSimilarly, for $x = 1$, we substitute into the polynomial and solve for the other variable.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute $x = 1$ into the polynomial\nBy substituting $x = 1$, we get: $1^5 - 1^4 + 1^3 - p(1)^2 + q(1) + 4 = 0$. Simplify to get: $1 - 1 + 1 - p + q + 4 = 0$.

We will substitute $x = -\\frac{7}{2}$ into the polynomial $6x^3+19x^2+cx+35$ and solve for $c$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute $x = -\\frac{7}{2}$ into the polynomial.\nUsing the remainder theorem with $x = -\\frac{7}{2}$, we have:\n\\[6\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3 + 19\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 + c\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right) + 35 = 0\\]\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $c$.\nFirst, compute the terms separately:\n\\[6\\left(-\\frac{343}{8}\\right) + 19\\left(\\frac{49}{4}\\right) + c\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right) + 35 = 0\\]\n\\[-\\frac{1029}{4} + \\frac{931}{4} - \\frac{7c}{2} + 35 = 0\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[-\\frac{98}{4} - \\frac{7c}{2} + \\frac{140}{4} = 0\\]\n\\[-98 + 140 - 14c = 0\\]\n\\[42 - 14c = 0\\]\n\\[42 = 14c\\]\n\\[c = 3\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$<|eot_id|>",

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number). This means \\(b = c = d = 2\\) as well.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum product abcd based on the equality condition\nWith \\(a = b = c = d = 2\\), the product \\(abcd = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\). This gives us the minimum value of \\(abcd\\) under the given constraint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$<|eot_id|>",

Solving for $d$ gives $d = -19$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the values of $a$ and $d$ from step 2 to find the value of $f(50)$, which is $x$.\nSubstituting $a = 7$ and $d = -19$ into $f(x) = ax + d$, we get $f(x) = 7x - 19$. Therefore, $f(50) = 7(50) - 19 = 350 - 19 = 331$. Thus, $x = 331$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{331}$<|eot_id|>",

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number).

        "To elevate your strawberry shortcake game, here are some posh options:\n\n**Option 1: Balsamic Strawberry Shortcake**\n\n* Add a drizzle of high-quality balsamic glaze (or reduced balsamic vinegar) to the sliced strawberries for a sweet and tangy flavor combination.\n* Replace heavy cream with a balsamic-infused whipped cream (whip heavy cream with a tablespoon of balsamic glaze and a bit of sugar).\n\n**Option 2: Lavender & Honey Shortcake**\n\n* Infuse the whipped cream with dried lavender buds (steep 1 tablespoon of lavender buds in 1 cup of heavy cream for 30 minutes, then strain).\n* Drizzle with a high-quality honey, such as truffle or rose petal honey.\n* Add some fresh lavender petals or edible flowers to the top of the shortcake for garnish.\n\n**Option 3: Browned Butter & Sea Salt Shortcake**\n\n* Instead of using regular butter, brown the butter in a skillet until it has a nutty aroma and then use it in the shortcake recipe.\n* Sprinkle a pinch of flaky sea salt (like Maldon or fleur de sel) over the whipped cream and strawberries.\n\n**Option 4: Grand Marnier-Soaked Shortcake**\n\n* Brush the shortcake with Grand Marnier or other orange-flavored liqueur before assembling the dessert.\n* Replace heavy cream with a Grand Marnier-infused whipped cream (whip heavy cream with a tablespoon of Grand Marnier and a bit of sugar).\n\n**Option 5: Fresh Mint & Basil Shortcake**\n\n* Add some fresh mint leaves to the sliced strawberries for a refreshing twist.\n* Use basil-infused whipped cream (steep 1 tablespoon of fresh basil leaves in 1 cup of heavy cream for 30 minutes, then strain).\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Use high-quality, fresh strawberries and let them sit at room temperature for a few hours to bring out their natural sweetness.\n* For a more intense strawberry flavor, use strawberry puree or jam as a topping or mix it with the whipped cream.\n* Experiment with different types of sugar, like turbinado or Demerara, for a slightly caramelized flavor.\n\nThese options will give your homemade strawberry shortcake a luxurious twist.

        "## Step 1: Understand the given constraint and the objective\nWe are given the equation \\((a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 + (c - 1)^2 + (d - 1)^2 = 4\\) and we need to find the minimum value of the product \\(abcd\\) for positive real numbers \\(a, b, c, d\\).\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the method to be used for solving the problem\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers could be a way to solve this problem, but since we are dealing with a constraint that involves squares and we are looking to minimize a product, considering inequalities such as the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality might offer a simpler solution path.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the AM-GM inequality to find the minimum product\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\), the following holds: \\(\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{x_1x_2\\ldots x_n}\\). Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number). This means \\(b = c = d = 2\\) as well.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum product abcd based on the equality condition\nWith \\(a = b = c = d = 2\\), the product \\(abcd = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\). This gives us the minimum value of \\(abcd\\) under the given constraint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$<|eot_id|>",

        "## Step 1: Identify the values from the given inverse trigonometric functions.\nLet $a = \\sin^{-1} \\frac{3}{5}$ and $b = \\tan^{-1} 2$. This implies that $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $\\tan b = 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the values of cosine and tangent for angle $a$.\nFrom $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$, we can find $\\cos a$ by using the Pythagorean identity: $\\cos^2 a = 1 - \\sin^2 a$. Substituting $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$ gives $\\cos^2 a = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{16}{25}$. Therefore, $\\cos a = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}} = \\pm \\frac{4}{5}$. Since $a$ is an angle in the first quadrant where cosine is positive, we take $\\cos a = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the values of sine and cosine for angle $b$.\nFrom $\\tan b = 2$, we know that $\\frac{\\sin b}{\\cos b} = 2$. This implies $\\sin b = 2 \\cos b$. Using the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 b + \\cos^2 b = 1$ and substituting $\\sin b = 2 \\cos b$, we get $(2\\cos b)^2 + \\cos^2 b = 1$, which simplifies to $5\\cos^2 b = 1$. Therefore, $\\cos^2 b = \\frac{1}{5}$, and thus $\\cos b = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$. Since $b$ is an angle in the first quadrant where cosine is positive, we take $\\cos b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ and then normalize it to $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$.\nFrom $\\sin b = 2\\cos b$ and $\\cos b = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, we find that $\\sin b = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $\\sin(a+b)$ using the values found.\nTo find $\\sin (a + b)$, we use the angle addition formula for sine: $\\sin(a + b) = \\sin a \\cos b + \\cos a \\sin b$.\nSubstituting the known values, we get $\\sin \\left( \\sin^{-1} \\frac{3}{5} + \\tan^{-1} 2 \\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic calculation for $\\sin(a+b)$.\n$\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{25} + \\frac{8\\sqrt{5}}{25}$.\nAdding the fractions gives us $\\frac{11\\sqrt{5}}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11\\sqrt{5}}{25}}$<|eot_id|>",

Since $a < b$, the intervals given suggest that $a=24$ and $b=26$, as $x$ values between $24$ and $26$ should also make the expression nonpositive, meaning there is a sign change at each of these points.\n\n## Step 5: Use the understanding from the previous steps to assign the value of c\nGiven that $a$ and $b$ are $24$ and $26$, $c$ must be the remaining critical point that allows the inequality to hold, which is $-4$. This is because for $x < -4$ the expression is nonpositive, indicating a sign change at $x=-4$, corresponding to $c$.\n\n## Step 6: Compute the sum $a + 2b + 3c$\nNow that we know $a=24$, $b=26$, and $c=-4$, we can simply calculate $a + 2b + 3c = 24 + 2(26) + 3(-4)$.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the arithmetic calculation\nWe compute $24 + 2(26) + 3(-4) = 24 + 52 - 12 = 64$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{64}$<|eot_id|>",

This form allows us to use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick or to rearrange the terms more easily.\n\n## Step 3: Rearrange and factor the equation\nRearranging the equation gives us $2ab + 10a - 3b - 15 = 222 - 15$. Simplifying this yields $2ab + 10a - 3b - 15 = 207$. Factoring the left side gives us $(2a - 3)(b + 5) = 207$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the prime factorization of 207 to find possible values for $a$ and $b$\nThe prime factorization of $207$ is $3^2 \\cdot 23$. Given that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we can use the factors of $207$ to find all possible combinations of $(2a - 3)$ and $(b + 5)$ that multiply to $207$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $a$ and $b$ using the factors of 207 and considering the constraint $a+b=24$\nThe possible combinations of $(2a - 3)$ and $(b + 5)$ based on the prime factorization are $(1, 207)$, $(3, 69)$, and $(9, 23)$.

Substituting into $a+c=29$ gives $a+\\frac{100}{a}=29$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $a$\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $a$ yields $a^2+100=29a$. Rearranging gives the quadratic equation $a^2-29a+100=0$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the quadratic equation\nThis quadratic equation factors as $(a-25)(a-4)=0$, so $a=4$ or $a=25$.\n\n## Step 9: Find the corresponding value of $c$\nSince $a<c$, if $a=4$, then $c=25$, which satisfies $a+c=29$ and $ac=100$.\n\n## Step 10: Verify that the pair satisfies the original conditions\nThe pair $(a,c) = (4,25)$ satisfies $a+c=29$, $a<c$, and gives the quadratic equation $4x^2+20x+25=0$ which has exactly one solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(4,25)}$<|eot_id|>",

Recognizing the form of this equation, we can apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick\nThe equation can be rewritten as $(x+1)(y+1) = 96$. This gives us a way to find the pairs of factors of 96, which can help in determining possible values for $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 4: Find pairs of factors of 96 and account for constraints\nNow, we look for pairs of factors of 96 that differ by more than 1 (to ensure relatively prime numbers) and are less than 21 when subtracted by 1 (to meet the condition that each integer is less than 20).\n\n## Step 5: List and evaluate factor pairs\n96 has several factor pairs: (1, 96), (2, 48), (3, 32), (4, 24), (6, 16), and (8, 12). However, after subtracting 1 from each factor, we need both resulting numbers to be less than 20 and relatively prime.\n\n## Step 6: Identify suitable pairs meeting all conditions\nFrom the factor pairs of 96, the pair (8, 12) when reduced by 1 gives us (7, 11), which meets all the given conditions: their product plus their sum equals 95, they are relatively prime, and each is less than 20.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the two integers\nNow that we have identified the two integers as 7 and 11, we simply need to calculate their sum to answer the question.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$<|eot_id|>"

Then, using the table again, we find that $f(5) = 8$. Therefore, $f(f(3)) = 8$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate $f(f^{-1}(4))$\nSince $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$, applying $f$ to the result of $f^{-1}(4)$ will give us back $4$ because $f^{-1}(4)$ will give us the value of $x$ for which $f(x) = 4$. According to the table, $f^{-1}(4)$ should give us the value of $x$ that corresponds to $f(x) = 4$, but since there's no direct inverse given in the table, we rely on the definition of an inverse to conclude that $f(f^{-1}(4)) = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5))$\nFirst, we need to find $f^{-1}(5)$. From the table, we can see that $f(3) = 5$, so $f^{-1}(5) = 3$. Then, we need to find $f^{-1}(3)$. Since $f(2) = 3$ according to the table, $f^{-1}(3) = 2$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = 2$.\n\n## Step 5: Add the results together\nNow we have all the pieces: $f(f(3)) = 8$, $f(f^{-1}(4)) = 4$, and $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = 2$.

Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as $2^{x+5} = (2^3)^{x-1}$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply exponent rule to the right side\nUsing the rule $(a^b)^c = a^{b \\cdot c}$, we can simplify the right side of the equation to $2^{3(x-1)}$.\n\n## Step 3: Equate the exponents\nNow we have $2^{x+5} = 2^{3(x-1)}$. Since the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents, giving $x+5 = 3(x-1)$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the linear equation\nExpanding the right side of the equation, we get $x + 5 = 3x - 3$. Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives $5 = 2x - 3$. Adding 3 to both sides gives $8 = 2x$. Finally, dividing by 2 gives $x = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$<|eot_id|>",

        "## Step 1: First, let's identify the roots of the second quadratic equation $x^2+px+m=0$ as $r_1$ and $r_2$.\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$. Applying this to our second equation, we get $r_1 + r_2 = -p$ and $r_1 * r_2 = m$.\n\n## Step 2: Since the roots of the first quadratic equation $x^2+mx+n=0$ are twice those of the second, we can denote them as $2r_1$ and $2r_2$.\nUsing Vieta's formulas again for the first equation, we find that the sum of its roots is $-m$ and the product of its roots is $n$. Therefore, we get $2r_1 + 2r_2 = -m$ and $(2r_1) * (2r_2) = n$.\n\n## Step 3: From step 2, we can express $-m = 2(r_1 + r_2)$.\nSubstituting $r_1 + r_2 = -p$ from step 1, we get $-m = 2(-p)$ which simplifies to $m = 2p$.\n\n## Step 4: Also from step 2, $n = 4r_1r_2$.\nSince $r_1r_2 = m$ from step 1, and knowing $m = 2p$ from step 3, we substitute to get $n = 4m = 4(2p) = 8p$.\n\n## Step 5: Finally, we need to find the value of $n/p$.\nGiven $n = 8p$ from step 4, dividing both sides by $p$ gives us $n/p = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$<|eot_id|>",

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number).

Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of $p$ and $q$.\n## Step 5:  From $5 - p + q = 0$, we can express $q$ in terms of $p$: $q = p - 5$.\n## Step 6:  Substitute $q$ from the second equation into the first: $-52 - 4p - 2(p - 5) = 0$ which simplifies to $-52 - 4p - 2p + 10 = 0$, leading to $-6p - 42 = 0$.\n## Step 7:  Solving $-6p - 42 = 0$ for $p$, we find $p = -7$.\n## Step 8:  With $p = -7$, substitute back to find $q$: $q = -7 - 5 = -12$.\n## Step 9:  Thus, the ordered pair $(p, q)$ that makes the given polynomial divisible by $(x + 2)(x - 1)$ is $(-7, -12)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( -7, \\  -12\\right)}$<|eot_id|>",

Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number). This means \\(b = c = d = 2\\) as well.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum product abcd based on the equality condition\nWith \\(a = b = c = d = 2\\), the product \\(abcd = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\).

Substituting $\\sin a = \\frac{3}{5}$ gives $\\cos^2 a = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{16}{25}$. Therefore, $\\cos a = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}} = \\pm \\frac{4}{5}$. Since $a$ is an angle in the first quadrant where cosine is positive, we take $\\cos a = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the values of sine and cosine for angle $b$.\nFrom $\\tan b = 2$, we know that $\\frac{\\sin b}{\\cos b} = 2$. This implies $\\sin b = 2 \\cos b$. Using the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 b + \\cos^2 b = 1$ and substituting $\\sin b = 2 \\cos b$, we get $(2\\cos b)^2 + \\cos^2 b = 1$, which simplifies to $5\\cos^2 b = 1$. Therefore, $\\cos^2 b = \\frac{1}{5}$, and thus $\\cos b = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$. Since $b$ is an angle in the first quadrant where cosine is positive, we take $\\cos b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ and then normalize it to $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$.\nFrom $\\sin b = 2\\cos b$ and $\\cos b = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, we find that $\\sin b = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $\\sin(a+b)$ using the values found.\nTo find $\\sin (a + b)$, we use the angle addition formula for sine: $\\sin(a + b) = \\sin a \\cos b + \\cos a \\sin b$.\nSubstituting the known values, we get $\\sin \\left( \\sin^{-1} \\frac{3}{5} + \\tan^{-1} 2 \\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic calculation for $\\sin(a+b)$.\n$\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{25} + \\frac{8\\sqrt{5}}{25}$.\nAdding the fractions gives us $\\frac{11\\sqrt{5}}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11\\sqrt{5}}{25}}$<|eot_id|>",

Applying Vieta's formulas, we get $r + s + t = -4$, $rs + rt + st = -7$, and $rst = 12$.\n## Step 5:  We're interested in finding $r^2 + s^2 + t^2$. To do this, we can use the relationship $(r+s+t)^2 = r^2 + s^2 + t^2 + 2(rs + rt + st)$.\n## Step 6:  Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get $r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = (r+s+t)^2 - 2(rs + rt + st)$. Using the given values, we find $r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = (-4)^2 - 2(-7) = 16 + 14 = 30$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the value of $r^2 + s^2 + t^2$ is $\\boxed{30}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$<|eot_id|>",

So, the equation becomes $\\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} + \\frac{1}{\\cos A} = 2$.\n\n## Step 2: We can rewrite the equation from step 1 in terms of sine and cosine by multiplying every term by $\\cos A$.\nMultiplying by $\\cos A$ gives us $\\sin A + 1 = 2\\cos A$.\n\n## Step 3: We can express $\\sin A$ in terms of $\\cos A$ from the equation obtained in step 2.\nRearranging gives us $\\sin A = 2\\cos A - 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Since $\\cos^2 A + \\sin^2 A = 1$ is a trigonometric identity, we can substitute $\\sin A$ from step 3 into this identity.\nSubstituting $\\sin A = 2\\cos A - 1$ into the identity gives us $\\cos^2 A + (2\\cos A - 1)^2 = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: We can solve the equation obtained in step 4 for $\\cos A$.\nExpanding $(2\\cos A - 1)^2$ gives $4\\cos^2 A - 4\\cos A + 1$.\nTherefore, $\\cos^2 A + 4\\cos^2 A - 4\\cos A + 1 = 1$ simplifies to $5\\cos^2 A - 4\\cos A = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Factor the equation obtained in step 5 to find the values of $\\cos A$.\nFactoring gives us $\\cos A(5\\cos A - 4) = 0$, leading to solutions $\\cos A = 0$ or $\\cos A = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n## Step 7: We need to verify the solutions obtained in step 6 to ensure they satisfy the original equation.\nSubstituting $\\cos A = 0$ into the original equation will lead to undefined values for $\\sec A$ and $\\tan A$, so it cannot be a solution.\nThus, $\\cos A = \\frac{4}{5}$ is the only valid solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$<|eot_id|>",

Since our $n$ here is the number of options for $k$, which ranges from 0 to 998, we have $n = 999$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the combination formula and simplify\nThe formula becomes ${999 + 10 - 1 \\choose 10} = {1008 \\choose 10}$.\n\n## Step 7: Find the value for m\nFrom the expression ${1008 \\choose 10}$, $m$ is 1008.\n\n## Step 8: Compute the remainder when m is divided by 1000\nThe remainder when 1008 is divided by 1000 is 8.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$<|eot_id|>",

        "## Step 1: Understand the given constraint and the objective\nWe are given the equation \\((a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 + (c - 1)^2 + (d - 1)^2 = 4\\) and we need to find the minimum value of the product \\(abcd\\) for positive real numbers \\(a, b, c, d\\).\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the method to be used for solving the problem\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers could be a way to solve this problem, but since we are dealing with a constraint that involves squares and we are looking to minimize a product, considering inequalities such as the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality might offer a simpler solution path.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the AM-GM inequality to find the minimum product\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\), the following holds: \\(\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{x_1x_2\\ldots x_n}\\). Equality holds if and only if \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\ldots = x_n\\). We can apply this to our problem by transforming the given equation into a suitable form.\n\n## Step 4: Transform the given equation to apply AM-GM\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be seen as a sum of squares, but directly applying AM-GM to \\((a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2 + (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2\\) won't directly lead us to the product \\(abcd\\). However, considering the equality case of AM-GM, we can think of a way to relate the sum of the terms to the product we're interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the equality condition and relate it to the product abcd\nSince the equality in AM-GM holds when all terms are equal, let's assume \\(a-1 = b-1 = c-1 = d-1\\). This implies \\(a = b = c = d\\). Substituting this into the original constraint, we get \\(4(a-1)^2 = 4\\), which simplifies to \\((a-1)^2 = 1\\), so \\(a-1 = \\pm1\\), leading to \\(a = 2\\) (since \\(a\\) is a positive real number). This means \\(b = c = d = 2\\) as well.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum product abcd based on the equality condition\nWith \\(a = b = c = d = 2\\), the product \\(abcd = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\). This gives us the minimum value of \\(abcd\\) under the given constraint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$<|eot_id|>",

The experiment involves drawing balls without replacement until only even numbers are left.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the condition for the first three draws to be odd numbers.\nFor the first three numbers drawn to be odd, the sequence must only include the odd numbers (1, 3, 5) in any order, as the experiment continues until only even numbers are left in the box.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of drawing an odd number on the first draw.\nThere are 3 odd numbers out of 6 total balls, so the probability of drawing an odd number on the first draw is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of drawing an odd number on the second draw, given that the first was odd.\nAfter removing one odd ball, there are 2 odd numbers left out of 5 balls, so the probability of drawing an odd number on the second draw is 2/5.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of drawing an odd number on the third draw, given that the first two were odd.\nAfter removing two odd balls, there is 1 odd number left out of 4 balls, so the probability of drawing an odd number on the third draw is 1/4.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the overall probability that the first three numbers drawn are odd by multiplying the probabilities from each step.\nTo find the overall probability, we multiply the probabilities of each draw being odd: (1/2) * (2/5) * (1/4) = 1/20.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{20}}$<|eot_id|>",

Substituting the values gives \\(w = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-48)}}{2(1)}\\), which simplifies to \\(w = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 192}}{2}\\), further simplifying to \\(w = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{196}}{2}\\). Therefore, \\(w = \\frac{-2 \\pm 14}{2}\\).

Substituting the doubled dimensions gives \\(d_{new}^2 = 12^2 + 16^2\\), which is \\(144 + 256 = 400\\).

We can rewrite this as \\[\nn\\cdot(n+2)\\cdot(n+4)\\cdot(n+6)\\cdot(n+8)\n\\], where each factor is two more than the previous one.\nSince \\(n\\) is an even number, we know that it must be divisible by both \\(2\\) and \\(4\\). Furthermore, since every even number is also divisible by \\(2\\), we know that the product of any two consecutive even numbers will also be divisible by \\(4\\). This means that both factors (\\(n\\) and \\(n+8\\)) are divisible by \\(4\\), so their product is divisible by \\(16\\).\nNext, let's look at the middle three terms: \\((n+2)\\), \\((n+4)\\) and \\((n+6)\\). Each of these terms has a common factor of \\(2\\), which means they're all multiples of \\(2\\). Additionally, they all have a factor of \\(3\\) because adding one to each term results in a multiple of \\(3\\). For instance, \\((n+2)+1=n+3\\), which is a multiple of \\(3\\). Similarly, \\((n+4)+1=n+5\\), which is again a multiple of \\(3\\). Finally, \\((n+6)+1=n+7\\), another multiple of \\(3\\). So, overall, the product of these three terms is a multiple of \\(2^3=8\\) due to the presence of the common factor of \\(2\\) among all the terms, and a multiple of \\(3^2=9\\) because of the additional factors of \\(3\\).\nLastly, considering the five original terms \\[\n(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)\n\\], observe that they increase by steps of \\(2\\) starting from \\(n+1\\). If we add any two adjacent terms together, the sum becomes a multiple of 4:\n\\begin{alignat*}{3}\n(n+1)+(n+3)&=2n+4\\\\\n(n+3)+(n+5)&=2n+8\\\\\n(n+5)+(n+7)&=2n+12\\\\\n(n+7)+(n+9)&=2n+16\\\\\n\\end{alignat*}\nEach of these sums is a multiple of \\(4\\) as the coefficients of the \\(n\\) terms are even, and \\(4\\), \\(8\\), \\(12\\), and \\(16\\) are all multiples of \\(4\\). Thus, the product of all five original terms can be written as the product of these pairwise sums: \\[\n(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)=[(n+1)+(n+3)][(n+3)+(n+5)][(n+5)+(n+7)][(n+7)+(n+9)]\n\\].\nAs we've seen, each sum in this product is a multiple of \\(4\\). Consequently, the product of these sums is a multiple of \\(4^4=256\\). Therefore, the largest integer that is a divisor of \\[\n(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)\n\\] for all positive even integers \\(n\\) is \\(256\\).\n<|im_end|><|eot_id|>",

        "and then input $b$ to find $y$, since $f(b) = f(f(f(y))) = y$. The correct order in which to find something that simplifies to either $a$ or $b$ using the recursive function $f$ so as to supply their sum requires two steps: first we must input $a$ to find $b$, and then we must input $b$ to find $a$. Therefore, $f(f(f(f(f(a))))) = f(f(f(f(a))))$ must somehow simplify to $a$, which it does given the input $f(a) = b$. But $f(b)$ does not necessarily equate $a$, since $f(b) = f(f(f(y))) = y$. Right now it would seem that $k$ is something of the form $f(f(f(a))) + f(f(a))$. To place the lowercase letters on either side of this equation (removing $f$), we have to have either $f(a) = b$ or $f(a) = y$. As we have seen, $f(a)$ doesn‚Äôt necessarily equal $y$. If, however, $k = f(f(b)) + f(b)$, $k$ is freed of $f$, and though $k$ as such is not necessarily equal to 0, with the condition that $a \\neq b$, we find $k = a + b$, or $k = 0$ as an answer that must be true for all real numbers $y$.\nMind you, I suck at math myself.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a sample program written in Python that implements this approach:\n```python   def find_lucky_number(first_num, second_num, third_num):\n                  #check every number between 10 and 99                   for i in range(10,100):                       digit_sum = sum([int(d) for d in str(i)])                       if (.2 * (digit_sum + first_num + second_num + third_num)) % i == 0:                           return i \n                      raise Exception(\"No solution found\")\nprint(\"The smallest lucky number is:\",find_lucky_number(57, 13, 72)) ```<|im_end|><|eot_id|>",

Additionally, $a|9n-2$, then $9n-2$ can be written as $(9\\times (-21)^{-1}\\times 6-2)$ which is $-1$ modulo $ab$. From this it follows that for $(9\\times (-21)^{-1}\\times 6-2)$ to have a solution, $(-1)^{-1}$ must exist modulo $ab$.\n\nCase analysis:\n\nCase 1 $5|ab \\rightarrow$ $(-1)^{-1}$ does not exist modulo $ab$.\n\nCase 2 $5\\nmid ab$ and $3|ab \\rightarrow$ $(-1)^{-1}$ exists modulo $ab$ iff $ab=3$.\n\nCase 3 $3\\nmid ab$ and $5\\nmid ab \\rightarrow$ $(-1)^{-1}$ exists modulo $ab$ for all other $ab$. To minimize $n$, set $ab=2$ as the smallest possible value.\n\nConclusion: $n=1$ does not satisfy case 1 nor case 2, hence the answer must be case 3 where $ab=2$. Substituting the values into $(9\\times (-21)^{-1}\\times 6-2) = -1 \\pmod {ab}$ yields $n\\equiv 4\\pmod {2}$.
